👋🏾 **Hi, I’m Innocent**

I love science, first-principles thinking, and building things that make technology more useful to people.

### Now
I’m building [**Roseline.ai**](https://roseline.ai) — an AI voice agent that helps healthcare organizations automate patient communication and documentation.  
I’m also the **CTO and co-founder of [Ubenwa Health](https://www.ubenwa.com/)**, where we use AI to analyze newborn cries for early diagnosis of neurological conditions.  
In **2022**, we raised **$2.5 million USD** to accelerate our mission of making low-cost diagnostic tools accessible to hospitals around the world.

### Previously
I led AI and data efforts at [**Curacel**](https://curacel.co/) (YC W22), helping build infrastructure for insurance inclusion in emerging markets.  
Before that, I directed AI programs at [**Coven Works**](https://www.covenworks.com/), training thousands of young Africans in data science and machine learning.  
I co-founded [**Oncenout**](https://web.archive.org/web/20181130124832/http://www.oncenout.com/) — a MEST-backed startup that tackled fashion waste through peer-to-peer clothing exchange.  
Earlier in my career, I worked with several U.S. companies as a **Senior Software Engineer at Andela**, building and scaling production systems across different industries.

### Speaking
I’ve shared thoughts on AI, startups, and innovation in several forums:
- **Opening Talk:** *Ayiti AI Hackathon 2025* — Haiti  
- **Deep Learning Indaba X Nigeria (2019):** *Introduction to Question Answering Systems* with [Oreva Ahia](https://x.com/orevaahia)  
- **TechCabal Townhall:** *How Artificial Intelligence Can Help Your Business Succeed*  
- **Fourth Industrial Revolution (ICTEL Expo 2019):** *Challenges in Health in Nigeria and the Role of Technology*

### Misc
When I’m inspired by something, I write about it.  
I’ve previously tried to build a working **bio-gas company in Nigeria**.  
I read widely — science, philosophy, and anything that explains how things work.  
I currently serve as a **Youth Ambassador at the [ECOWAS Commission](https://www.ecowas.int/)**, supporting innovation and youth empowerment across West Africa.  
I share thoughts and small experiments [on X (Twitter)](#) sometimes.
