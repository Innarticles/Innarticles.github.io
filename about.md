Over the years, I have led software engineering efforts across health tech. My interest is in building AI applications, primarily in high-impact problems; 

I am currently a co-founder and Software Engineering lead at [Ubenwa.ai](https://ubenwa.ai).
Our aim at Ubenwa is to develop cry-based, low-cost tools for diagnosing conditions affecting newborns' central and autonomic nervous systems early. Our work is funded by generous grants from Mila, Ministère de l’Économie et d’Innovation ([MEI](https://www.economie.gouv.qc.ca/en/)) du Québec, [District 3](http://d3center.ca/) Innovation Centre, and [MIT Solve](https://solve.mit.edu/).

I was Chief Data Scientist at [Curacel (YC W22)](https://curacel.co): Curacel was founded to create the much-needed infrastructure that will drive insurance inclusion across emerging markets.

In 2018, I helped kick off nationwide Artificial Intelligence training as the Director of Artificial Intelligence at [Coven Works](https://teckexperts.com/coven-works-launches-ai-school-2270.html). CovenWorks' vision is to get 10,000 youths into Data Science and its related fields. 

In 2016, I co-founded and led the engineering team at Oncenout.com(now defunct) as the CTO. The MESTAfrica backed startup aimed to address the issue of fashion waste by encouraging people to trade their unwanted closets through a web application.
