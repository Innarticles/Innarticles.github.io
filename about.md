I'm called Innocent. For most part - I am. I code. I data. I learn. I live. But I live for the better of others. Not kidding. Its a pattern - my pattern. 

## Code
- Ruby on Rails - Super comfortable. Can build a CMS in a day!
- Meteor.js - Got this super comfortable - until React came in. I do reasonable here.
- Android - For the love of it. 

## Data
- Data Science is it for me.
- Building products powered by DS is fun and magic - the magic keeps me at it!
- Second place at the first Machine Hackathon in Nigera. Well the  $$ was good!
- Co-founder and Software Engineering lead at Ubenwa.com - AI for health diagnostics in a mission to save 1.2m infants deaths  -  [here](ubenwa.com)
- Data Science Faculty Lead at [Coven Labs](covenlabs.com) - Empowering 10,000 marginalized youth with Data Science skill-sets.

## I am 
- Building Oncenout.com with Rails

## I want to
