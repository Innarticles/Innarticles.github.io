I'm called Innocent. For most part - I am. I code. I data. I learn. I live. But I live for the better of others. Not kidding. Its a pattern - my pattern. 

## Code
- Ruby on Rails - Super comfortable. Can build a CMS in a day!
- Meteor.js - Got this super comfortable - until React came in. I do reasonable here.
- Android - For the love of it. 

## Data
- DS is it for me 
- Building products powered by DS is fun and magic - the magic keeps me at it!
- Second place at the first Machine Hackathon in Nigera. Well the  $$ was good!
- Co-founder and Developer at Ubenwa.com - full scale ML for health diagnositcs -  here
