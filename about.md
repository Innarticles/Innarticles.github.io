Over the years, I have led software engineering efforts across various industries, including health, commerce, and education. My primary interest lies in building AI-powered applications to address high-impact problems.

- **Ubenwa Health:** Currently, I am the co-founder and Software Engineering lead at [Ubenwa Health](https://www.ubenwa.com/). At Ubenwa, our mission is to develop cry-based, low-cost tools for early diagnosis of conditions affecting newborns' central and autonomic nervous systems. We are grateful for generous grants from organizations like [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), [Ministère de l'Économie et d'Innovation (MEI) du Québec](https://www.economie.gouv.qc.ca/), [District 3 Innovation Centre](https://www.district3.co/), and [MIT Solve](https://solve.mit.edu/).

- **Curacel:** I previously served as the Chief Data Scientist at [Curacel](https://curacel.co/) (YC W22). Curacel was founded to create essential infrastructure for driving insurance inclusion in emerging markets. I led research and development efforts focused on creating advanced fraud detection algorithms for insurance claims.

- **Coven Works:** In 2018, I played a pivotal role in initiating region-wide (mainly West Africa) Artificial Intelligence training as the Director of Artificial Intelligence at [Coven Works](https://www.covenworks.com/). Coven Works' vision is to empower 10,000 youths in Data Science and related fields.

- **Oncenout.com (now defunct):** In 2016, I co-founded and led the engineering team at [Oncenout.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20181130124832/http://www.oncenout.com/) (now defunct). This MESTAfrica-backed startup aimed to tackle fashion waste by encouraging people to trade unwanted clothing items through an intuitive web application.

**What's New?**
- **ECOWAS Commission:** Starting in August 2022, I have taken on the role of Youth Ambassador at the [ECOWAS Commission](https://www.ecowas.int/).

- **Funding Round:** On July 25, 2022, we successfully closed a US$2.5 million pre-seed funding round at Ubenwa Health.
