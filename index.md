Over the years, I have led software engineering efforts across health, commerce and education. My interest is in building AI-powered applications, primarily in high-impact problems.

I am currently the co-founder and Software Engineering lead at [Ubenwa Health](https://ubenwa.ai). Our aim at Ubenwa is to develop cry-based, low-cost tools for diagnosing conditions affecting newborns’ central and autonomic nervous systems early. Our work is funded by generous grants from Mila, Ministère de l’Économie et d’Innovation ([MEI](https://www.economie.gouv.qc.ca/en/)) du Québec, [District 3](http://d3center.ca/) Innovation Centre, and [MIT Solve](https://solve.mit.edu/).

I have also served as a Chief Data Scientist at [Curacel (YC W22)](https://curacel.co). Curacel was founded to create the much-needed infrastructure to drive insurance inclusion across emerging markets.

In 2018, I helped kick off a region-wide (mainly West Africa)  Artificial Intelligence training as the Director of Artificial Intelligence at [Coven Works](https://teckexperts.com/coven-works-launches-ai-school-2270.html). CovenWorks’ vision is to get 10,000 youths into Data Science and its related fields.

In 2016, I co-founded and led the engineering team at Oncenout.com(now defunct) as the CTO. The MESTAfrica-backed startup aimed to address the issue of fashion waste by encouraging people to trade their unwanted closets through an intuitive web application.
